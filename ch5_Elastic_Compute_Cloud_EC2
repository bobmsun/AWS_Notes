EC2 Pricing Options
Exam Tips 


Introducing EC2:
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

    Secure, resizable computte capacity in the cloud.

    Like a VM, only hosted in AWS instead of your own data center.

    Designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

    The capacity you want when you need it.
    
    You are in complete control of your onw instances.


Introducing EC2:
    Game Changer: AWS led a big change in the industry by introducing EC2.
    
    Pay Only for What You Use: EC2 changed the economics of computing.
    
    No Wasted Capacity: Select the capacity you need right now. Grow and shrink when you need.


Introducing EC2:
    On-premises Infrastructure
    Estimate Capacity
    Long-term investment, 3-5 years.
    Expectation that the application will "grow into" it.
    Lots of wasted capacity.

    有了 EC2 之后，wait minutes, not months


EC2 Pricing Options:
    On-Demand: 
        Pay by the hour or the second, depending on the type of instance you run.
    Reserved: 
        Reserved capacity for 1 or 3 years. Up to 72% discount on the hourly charge.
    Spot:
        Purchase unused capacity at discount of up to 90%. Prices fluctuate with supply and demand.
    Dedicated:
        A physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. The most expensive option.


EC2 Pricing Option - On-Demand Instances:
1. Flexible: 
    Low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any upfron payment or long-term commitment.
2. Short-Term: 
    Applictions with short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
3. Testing the Water:
    Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.


EC2 Pricing Option - Reserved Instances:
    Predictale Usage:
        Applications with steady state or predictale usage.
    Specific Capacity Requirements:
        Applications that require reserved capacity.
    Pay up Front:
        You can make upfront payments to reduce the total computing costs even further.
    Standard RIs:
        Up to 72% off the on-demand price.
    Convertible RIs:
        up to 54% off the on-demand price. Has the option to change to a different RI type of equal or greater value.
    Scheduled RIs:
        Launch within the time window you define. Match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fratcion of a day, week, or month.
Reserved Instances operate at a regional level.


Savings Plans with Reserved Instances:
1. Save up to 72%:
    All AWS compute usage, regardless of instance type or Region.
2. Commit to 1 or 3 Years:
    Commit to use a specific amount of compute power (measured by the hour) for a 1-year or 3-year period.
3. Super Flexible:
    Not only EC2, this also includes serverless technologies like Lambda and Fargate.


EC2 Pricing Options - When to Use Spot Instances:
    Flexible:
        Applications that have flexible start and end times
    Cost Sensitive:
        Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices.
    Urgent Capacity:
        Users with an urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity.
    Image rendering
    Genomic sequencing
    Algorithmic trading engines.


EC2 Pricing Options - Dedicated Hosts
    Compliance
        Regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualiztion.
    Licensing
        Great for licensing that does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
    On-Demand
        Can be purchased on-demand (hourly).
    Reserved
        Can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the on-demand price.

EC2 Instance Pricing Options:
    On-Demand:
        Pay by the hour or the second, depending on the type of instance you run. Great for flexibility.
    Reserved:
        Reserved capacity for 1 or 3 years.
        Up to 72% discount on the hourly change.
        Great if you have known, fixed requirements.
    Spot:
        Purchase unused capacity at a discount of up to 90%. Prices fluctuate with supply and demand. Great for applications with flexible start and end times.
    Dedicated:
        A physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Great if you have server-bound licenses to reuse or compliance requirements.
    


Chapter 5.3 - AWS Command Line

Lesson Breakdown
    The AWS Management Console
    Command Line Interactions
    Lesson Objectives
    AWS CLI - Demo
    Exam Tips


The AWS Management Console

AWS Command Line:
    You can also interact with AWS using the Command Line.
    The AWS command line allows you to interact with AWS simply by typing commands.
    In this example we will list all our buckets in S3.
        aws s3 ls
    
Lesson Objectives:
1. Launch an EC2 Instance
    This is where we will use the AWS CLI.
2. Create an IAM User
    Give the user permissions to access and create S3 resources.
3. Configure the AWS CLI
    Configure the CLI using teh IAM user's credentials.
    Use the CLI to create an S3 bucket and upload a file.

AWS CLI Exam Tips
Least Privilege:
    Always give your users the minimum amount of access required to do their job.
Use Groups:
    Create IAM groups and assign your users to groups.
    Group permissions are assigned using IAM policy documents.
    Your users will automatically inherit the permissions of the group.


3 AWS CLI Exam Tips:
1. Secret Access Key:
    You will only see this once! If you lose it, you can delete the access key ID and secret access key and regenerate them. You will need to run "aws configure" again.
2. Don't Share Key Pairs
    Each deleoper should have their own access key ID and secret access key. Just like passwords, they should not be shared.
3. Supports Linux, Windows, MacOS
    You can install the CLI on your Mac, Linux, or Windows PC. You can also use it on EC2 instances.
